**Topic:** Analysis of Artificial Intelligence automation in Security Operations Centers (SOCs).

**Focus:** Operational Efficiency vs. Analyst Burnout.

**Status:** Completed

### 📄 Abstract
  Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into cybersecurity operations is readily transforming the industry. While most of today's focus is on financial and the operational benefits AI provides–such as quicker incident response times and cost savings–less attention has been paid to how these tools impact the human element of cyber defense. Due to "alert fatigue" and burnout, cybersecurity professionals face high turnover rates, creating a "hidden" or lesser known vulnerability in the security posture. 
  This paper analyzes data from recent sources, 2024 and 2025, to evaluate the impact AI has on both operational efficiency and employee job satisfaction. The findings indicated that while AI significantly reduced response time which also lowered breach costs, its ability to automate repetitive tasks also plays a vital role in mitigating burnout. This paper argues that it is in an organization's best interests to adopt a balanced security strategy that views employees well-being not just as an HR concern, but as a long-term piece of the security infrastructure.
